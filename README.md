# TestApp

My first experience with Android programming. So far we have a simple app which lets you drag a large triangle around. Next up is to add a scoring system so that you get points the longer you move the shape.

Known bugs: Triangle doesn't really seem to care about screen edges. Try not to lose the Triangle or its game over. Working on that.
